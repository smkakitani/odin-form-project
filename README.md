# odin-form-project

This project was made following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Form and Form Validation lesson, creating a basic form using HTML `<form>` element, `<input>` element and it's corresponding `<type>`, `<label>` and attributes for better accessability and form validations. The CSS, in addition to layout and style, was used for better user readability in form validations.
